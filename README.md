If you aren’t familiar with the band, you might think SEVENTEEN has the eponymous number of members. But that’s not true. Despite what the name may suggest, the band has 13 members who are further divided into three sub-groups. The thirteen members – S.Coups, Jeonghan, Joshua, Jun, Hoshi, Wonwoo, Woozi, DK, Mingyu, The8, Seungkwan, Vernon, and Dino – are all divided into the genres of hip-hop, vocal, and performance based on their expertise. While S. Coups leads the hip-pop troupe and SEVENTEEN as a whole, Woozi and Hoshi head the vocal and performance groups respectively.

### Stray Kids

The group's name "Stray Kids" was not defined by JYP Entertainment but conceptualized by the members themselves. It originally referred to a lost child who wants to chase their dreams and later evolved to represent the idea of finding a way together out of the ordinary.

### NCT

Introduced in January 2016, the group currently consists of 26 members divided into six different sub-units: NCT U, NCT 127, NCT Dream, WayV, NCT DoJaeJung, and NCT New Team.[3] They are notable for their versatility in music, vocal and rap abilities, and powerful performances, and have been cited as K-pop's "most experimental boy band" due to their concept of having limitless members.[4] As of May 2023, NCT has recorded more than 32 million[b] album sales across all sub-units, making them the best-selling act under SM Entertainment and one of the best-selling K-pop artists of all-time.

The name Enhypen was introduced during the live broadcast of the final episode of I-Land. Etymologically, the group derives their name from the hyphen symbol (-), representing "Connection, Discovery, & Growth". Similar to how a hyphen connects different words to create new meanings, Enhypen aims "to come together to connect, discover and grow together to form a new act".
